THis will be deleted soon.
The test continues.

Is it important to do this test?
Yes.

Why?
We are at the begin of long journey, good AVR+Rust.
There is some friction, at least I feel some friction.
That (possible) friction shouldn't exist,
it will damage the project we both care about.

What is the short term goal?
Better understanding of "git commit message" versus "github PR text".
